# AI-Chicken
The project that represents the usage of Graphs and technologies for machine-learning

Computer game in which the player controls the chicken. 
The task of the **chicken** is t**o water all the dry plants** and on the way to one of the plants say what vegetable she got on the road.

To explore the method of artificial intelligence in the game added **Agent**, which controls this chicken. 
Using the **Genetic Algorithm** he chooses the closest plant to water and using another algorithm **Astar Graph search** he looks for the best road to that plant. 
Rocks may interfere with his path, so he must not crash into them. The agent also uses a** Neural Network model** we learned on vegetable recognition, where each vegetable had 1000 images. 
At the time when a vegetable is on the path, the image from the vegetable is loaded into the algorithm and it writes the name of this vegetable into the terminal.
